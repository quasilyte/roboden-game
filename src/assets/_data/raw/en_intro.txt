##tutorial.resources_priority
There are four priorities that govern the colony.

The resources priority makes workers more eager
to gather various minerals around the base.

[press ENTER to continue]

##tutorial.growth_priority
The growth priority affects drone production
and building construction rate. It also increases
the number of drones the colony will have.

[press ENTER to continue]

##tutorial.evolution_priority
The evolution priority is needed to make
tier 1 drones combine into something more powerful.

[press ENTER to continue]

##tutorial.security_priority
The security priority changes the worker-to-combat
drone proportion. The higher security priority
means more military units.

Select the radius increase disk whether it
appears on the selection.

##tutorial.base_leveling
Increasing the radius and evolving the drones
are the two main ways to create a stronger colony.

[press ENTER to continue]

increase the colony's radius and growth,
and combine the right drones via evolution.
