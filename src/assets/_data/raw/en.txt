##tutorial.message1
Welcome to the Roboden tutorial!

You continue by clicking
on the tutorial window.

Try it right now, get to the
next tutorial message.

##tutorial.message2
Great!

The map is bigger than the
camera boundaries.

Try panning the camery:
move cursor to the screen edge.

You can also use arrow keys
or your middle mouse button.

##tutorial.message3
Your second colony is located
to the south-west from your
initial location.

You can press TAB to switch
between colonies easily.
If you only have one base, it'll
center the camera on that.

Left-clicking the colony works too.

##tutorial.message4
You can move a colony by
clicking the right mouse button
on the destination spot.

Keep in mind that colonies
have limited max flight range.

Try moving either of your bases.

##tutorial.message5
You lose if all of your colonies
are destroyed.

You win if you defeat the boss.

There is a boss-detection radar
in the upper right corner.
Try finding the boss on this map,
but don't engage it just yet.

##tutorial.message6
Your colonies were active
all this time.

Every colony should have its
drones: workers and fighters.

Workers are good at keeping
the base functioning while
fighters are defending it and,
ultimately, defeat the boss.

##tutorial.message7
All colonies need resources
to build drones and bases.

The colony resource level is
indicated by the middle yellow
bar on its body. It can be empty.

The resources are collected by
workers around the base.

##tutorial.message8
Apart from the movement,
there is also a choice selection.

Both movement and choices use
the same action gauge that
needs to recharge afterwards.

##tutorial.message9
Try using any of the actions
from the bottom right corner.

Click on the action label with
your left mouse button.
It's also possible to use the
hotkeys: 1-5 and Q-T.

Actions are shared between the
colonies, but their effects are not.

##tutorial.message10
Every choice does two main
things. It adjusts the colony
priorities (text) and shifts the
factions distribution (color).

Priorities affect the way colony
is behaving: what does it do,
and how often.

Factions affect the robots.

##tutorial.message11
You don't have to choose a
new priority every phase right
away, the colony will follow
its current priorities just fine.

Note that changing the priorities
will not always yield an immediate
result. Observe it over time.

##tutorial.message12
The option combinations are random.

Resources: more focus on gathering.
Growth: increase drones population.
Evolution: merge drones more often.
Security: sets combat unit ratio.

Increasing one priority means
decreasing the others.

##tutorial.message13
The fifth option choice is different.

It's usually some direct action that
has an immediate effect.

It doesn't affect the factions.
It doesn't change the priorities.

##tutorial.message14
Try getting more colored drones.

Mine resources, pick faction
choices, evolve your drones.

If resources run out, move
colony to a new location.

##tutorial.message15
Now you know the basics.

It's time for you to discover
the rest by yourself.

You can win the tutorial level
by defeating the boss. Or you
can leave by pressing ESC.

##tutorial.message_last
Good luck and good hunting.
